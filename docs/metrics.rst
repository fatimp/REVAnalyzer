Porosity
----------
Subcube porosity is calculated by counting the number of pore voxels with subsequent normalization over the total number of voxels in the considered volume.

Permeability
------------

In order to compute permeability K, FDMSS,
the external solver of Stokesâ€™s equation within 3D pore geometries with 4th order spatial accuracy scheme.

Euler Number
------------

PNM characteristics
