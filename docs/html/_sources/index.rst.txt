REVAanalyzer
=======================================

REVAnalyzer is an open source package for representativity analysis of binary images.
It aims at representativity analysis for **porosity**, **permeability**, **pore-network** characteristics, **correlation
functions** and **persistence diagrams**. Both **scalar** and **vector** metrics can be considered.
Using REVAnalyzer library one can estimate **determenistic** and **statistical** representative elementary volumes (**dREV** and **sREV**).
for these metrics.
